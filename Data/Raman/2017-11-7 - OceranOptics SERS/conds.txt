SERS OCEANOPTICS

Height optimized
Time optimized to 25k reads peak - 15s 
StA = 3

5 repetitions are made twisting the sample around to get some variance.

5 water
5 ec10
5 ec1

just SERS were only twisted once.
Ethanol looks strange...

There was some "dying down" of the signal so to normalize this, all sampling was done by turning on the laser ~1 second before the start of the scan and off immediately after the end if a scan to "rest" for 45 secs.

There seemed to be a lot of variation in regards to general intensity so no obvious conclusions could be made.
