samples of 400uL in aluminum cup.
laser intensity = 1
time = 40 X 3 to average
height was optimized with ethanol (<1sec integration time looking for max peaks)

Samples were made using Korotin protocol, i.e: 
1. Growing lawns of Clavibacter
2. adding 1 ml of saline to the lawn plate
3. scraping the lawn and taking the solution created
4. diluting is saline to OD=1
5. serial 1:10 dilutions. 

samples used: 
saline (control)
1:10
1:10^2
1:10^3
1:10^4
